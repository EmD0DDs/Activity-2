            <h1>Welcome!</h1>
           <p>I am a senior at University of Nebraska - Omaha. 
            I am studying computer science with a concentration in 
            video game development. Developing video games had been my passion since 
            I started playing them. I have learned many 
            programming languages in my time at UNO. I learned Python, 
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Perl, R, and C. I also knows Spanish. All of these
            languages help me to succeed at my schoolwork.</p><br>
            <p>During the day, I watches my younger sister, Taylor. She is 
            four and quite the handful! I also have six other siblings ranging from
            24 years old to just under one month old. My family is split between two
            households. My mom's with my 2 siblings and my half-sister and my dad's with 
            my three step-siblings and my other half-sister.
